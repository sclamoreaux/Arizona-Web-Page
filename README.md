## Arizona Web Page

"Experience the Beauty of Arizona"

This Arizona-themed web page is one of my first self-directed projects created in order to practice the web development skills I've been learning the past several months. It pays tribute to the beautiful natural landscape of my home state, utilizing several foundational techniques of web development, including the following:

1. HTML5 tags to organize the markup logically.
2. CSS flexbox properties to create a responsive layout, built using a mobile-first approach. The arrangement of columns is re-arranged at different breakpoints using the appropriate flexbox values.
3. CSS transitions and transforms to animate hover effects on elements that should be clicked to show new content.
4. JavaScript and jQuery to create photo galleries that pop up when a figure is clicked. Each figure activates a unique set of captioned photos which the user can then advance through with on-screen buttons or their keyboard.
5. JavaScript to work with the Google Maps API to generate customized maps that pop up when certain photos are clicked. The maps use colors and icons that match the palette of the web page, along with a descriptive info window that appears when the icon is clicked.
6. jQuery to make an expandable/collapsible element which is activated by a button that switches between "Show"/"Hide".
7. Utilizing a JS plug-in called MediaElement.js to create a customized video player element that will look and function consistently across browsers.

ATTN: All photographs belong to me. You may not redistribute or re-purpose them in any way.
